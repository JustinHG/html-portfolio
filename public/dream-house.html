<h2> Background of the construction</h2>
<p>Justin and Adriana bought the lot in 2021 post COVID as an investment property after a good year financially</p>
<p>After another good year, enough was saved to consider the possibility of a construction
</p>
<p>Inti Picado was selected as the architect and Scotia bank Costa Rica eventually negotiated to finance the construction</p>
